Welcome to the Squirrel App üêø! 

We have implemented a squirrel tracker app on Django for Central Park in New York City with the following features:
1) A map that displays 100 squirrels.(/map)
2) A sightings summary page with links to edit each sighting or add a new sighting.(/sightings)
3) A page to add new sightings.(sightings/add)
4) A page to edit existing sightings.(sightings/<unique_squirrel_id>)
5) A statstics page.(sightings/stats)
In addition the contains custom made management commands to import data from a csv file and export new update along with previous data to a new csv file.
